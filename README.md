# 3d-Table-Scene-Portfolio
3d Table Scene created in OpenGL

#	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this project has allowed me to significantly enhance my own design skills by translating and reconstructing a 3d scene from the original images that I used. I also improved my own knowledge of color and lighting which allowed me to produce a scene blended with natural tones.
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process I followed for this project consisted of planning, implementation, and modification. Throughout each module I would first plan out the required work I needed to achieve and then execute the plan until the requirements were meant. After meeting the functional requirements, I would then look into any other modifications or changes if necessary.
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think this design methodology worked well not only in this project, but could also extend to future projects or new creations that I might plan for the future. One thing that I might change before starting a larger scale project would be to spend more time on the initial planning phase.
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I utilized several new development strategies while working on my own 3D scene such as incorporating Visual Studio code features such as a post build event which would copy the scenes texture into the release folder. Linking and setting up all the OpenGL libraries was another useful strategy to ensure my 3D scene had all the proper functionality from the start of development.
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a large role during the development of this project and the content in this course. During each module I felt that I was able to add new features and iterate upon existing components for a better experience. One example of iteration was with the development of a camera system for navigating the world. Initially I had the camera within the same source file but I eventually refactored the code to be contained within a header file to make changes easier.
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Refactoring existing code after achieving the functional requirements was something I embraced throughout the milestones of this project. The lighting object I created for this scene was further refined to allow another type of lighting which would follow the user around the camera and provided meaningful contrast.
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Learning about computer graphics has been an empowering experience as it allowed me to recreate a digital space which I created and designed from the start. Computer graphics enables a wide variety of applications and technologies which are essential to our modern world and can also be applied to my own personal education goals.
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
As someone who has always been interested in graphics and game development, having a deep understanding of computer graphics and OpenGL gives me the foundation to create even larger and more compelling digital worlds in the future.
